# Visualization of Thermally-driven Flow over the Alpine Region - Semester Thesis

This repo contains (parts of) my semester thesis. It is about displaying wind trajectories. Due to some time mismanagement on my part, it lacks a lot of polish.

The report is found under mt_template/thesis.pdf

Note also that the meteorological data I used is not in this repository.

\section{more serious}
Overall, it's fine. It is possible to compute trajectories and view them without bugs. Performance-wise, our code runs significantly faster than LAGRANTO.

There are several possible extensions:

- Improving the input interface so it is possible to read most parameters from files instead of entering them manually each time

- Parallelizing more: Currently the loop for propagating all trajectories is parallelized with OpenMP in a very simple manner. That is all.

- Better solver: Who knows if I really did it right?

- Different outputs: Maybe you want something other than just points?

- The viewer has only very basic functionality. Most settings are hardcoded and there is no GUI to speak of.

\chapter{Introduction}

A common problem in meteorology is to find wind trajectories with certain properties, e.g. passing through a certain region, carrying particularly warm or humid air, etc.
LAGRANTO \cite{src:lagranto} is an existing tool for computing trajectories from wind velocity fields. We aim to create a similar program in a more modern programming language - C++ as opposed to Fortran. While reconstructing LAGRANTO is our base goal, we would like to get better performance and/or results as well.
We succeeded in reproducing the results from LAGRANTO. Along the way, we discovered a few questionable algorithmic choices in the LAGRANTO code, some of which were later reimplemented for comparison purposes.
% a few problems(TODO "problems") in the LAGRANTO code became apparent
% we found a few elements in the LAGRANTO code which were of questionable correctness,

% allowing us to avoid those in our version.

\chapter{Introduction}

A common problem in meteorology is to find wind trajectories with certain properties, e.g. passing through a certain region, carrying particularly warm or humid air, etc.
LAGRANTO is an existing tool for computing trajectories from wind velocity fields. We aim to create a similar program in a more modern programming language - C++ as opposed to Fortran. While reconstructing LAGRANTO is our base goal, we would like to get better performance and/or results as well.
We succeeded in reproducing the results from LArsionGRANTO. Along the way, a few problems in the LAGRANTO code became apparent, allowing us to avoid thos vee in our.

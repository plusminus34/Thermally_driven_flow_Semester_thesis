\chapter{Introduction}

A common problem in meteorology is to find wind trajectories with certain properties, e.g. passing through a certain region, carrying particularly warm or humid air, etc.
LAGRANTO (\cite{src:lagranto}) is an existing Fortran-based program for computing trajectories from wind velocity fields.
We aim to create a similar program in C++. While reconstructing LAGRANTO is our base goal, we would like to get better performance and/or results as well.

There are LAGRANTO variants for different types of input data. We work with the COSMO version because all our input data is in the COSMO model.

For the visualization, we use VTK, the Visualization Tool Kit (\cite{src:vtk}.

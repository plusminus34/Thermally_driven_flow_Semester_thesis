\section{Comparison}
Comparing results: I can reproduce LAGRANTO pretty well ... and which improvements do more or less?
% sampling four or one pillars is not so important
% using the correct W is more
% how about just rungekutta?

\section{Performance}
All time measurements in the part above were taken on the same machine: It has an Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Core\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} i5-3427U CPU running at $1.80$ GHz with $7.7$ GiB of memory.

First experiment: $4$ trajectories, $7$ input files, $60$ iterations. Most of the work is reading the files.
Second experiment: $459045$ trajectories, $7$ input files and $60$ iterations again. This involves more computations.

LAGRANTO times are: $4$ m $12$ s for the first, $19$ m $08$ s for the second.
My times are: $1$ m $37$ s for the first, $4$ m $35$ s for the second.
